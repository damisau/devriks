    The development of RIKS started as a project within
    <a href="http://www.garnet-eu.org">GARNET</a>. GARNET is a
    Network of Excellence on Global Governance, Regionalisation and Regulation:
    The Role of the EU funded under the European Commissionâ€™s 6th Framework
    Programme and comprising 42 leading research centres and universities.
    It is coordinated by the Centre for the Study of Globalisation and
    Regionalisation at the University of Warwick.
</p>
<p>
    With the expiration of the GARNET funding by the European Commission,
    UNU-CRIS has taken over the funding of the RIKS system. If you are
    interested in an institutionalized collaboration in
    the form of a technological partnership, sponsoring or as a content provider
    you are invited to contact <a href="mailto:director@cris.unu.edu">the
    director of UNU-CRIS</a>
