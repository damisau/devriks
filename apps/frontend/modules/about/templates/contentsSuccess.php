   The Regional Integration Knowledge System (RIKS) is divided into six thematic
   modules. Each module is providing information and data helping researchers
   and practitioners studying and assessing regional integration processes
   world-wide.

<p>
    If you would like to know more about RIKS, its history or how we gather
    and process data for our various indicators and sections, head to the
    <a href="/riks/web/static/about/">about RIKS</a> section. There you will
    also find information about how to contact the developer of RIKS.

<p>
    The <a href="/riks/web/static/database/">database section</a> is at the core
    of the RIKS system. Here you will find qualitative and quantitative information
    on regional arrangements world-wide. Our economic and social indicators
    provide comparable data on a large number of regional arrangements, starting
    as early as 1970. Here you can also find the UNU-CRIS archive of legal texts.

    The <a href="/riks/web/news/google/">news section</a> is the place where
    you can browse the latest news related to regional integration in general.
    News articles are provided by the Google news service, and we present a
    selection of other relevant sources.

    Our <a href="/riks/web/static/research/">Research section</a> gives an
    overview of journals, research centres, and working papers that are related
    to the study of regional integration. Similar to this, we provide you with a
    list of websites and platforms dealing with regional integration in our
    <a href="/riks/web/static/related/">related platforms section</a>.
