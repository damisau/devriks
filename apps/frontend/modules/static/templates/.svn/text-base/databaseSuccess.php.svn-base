<h1>Databases</h1>
<p>
    The database section of the Regional Integration Knowledge System consists
    of qualitative and quantitative data on regional integration processes and
    degrees of regional interdependence.</p>
<p>
    The regional arrangements section provides qualitative data on regional
    arrangements, single countries as members of different arragengements as well
    as maps illustrating membership and geographic location.</p>
<p>
    Users interested in quantitative data on regional arrangements should
    use our regional indicators section, where data is available for a
    number of pre-defined arrangements but where we also offer the possibility
    to define a regional arrangement by choosing from a list of countries.</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, users can explore our archive of legal texts, containing
    a vast collection of founding documents of regional arrangements as well as
    other related texts.</p>
<p>
    Last but not least you can find links to other valuable sources of information
    about regional arrangements within the section links to other databases.</p>
