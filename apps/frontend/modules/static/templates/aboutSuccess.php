<p>The Regional Integration Knowledge System (RIKS) is a joint initiative taken by
    <a href="www.cris.unu.edu">UNU-CRIS</a> in the framework of the
    <a href="www.garnet-eu.org">GARNET Network of Excellence</a> and
    various partner institutes and organisations.
</p>
<p>
    It has the ambition to provide a
    central node for information exchange on regional integration processes
    worldwide and to constitute a ‘missing link’ between the existing regional
    initiatives for information provision on regional integration and cooperation.
