<P>
    This (growing) section provides an overview of platforms that are similar to RIKS,
    platforms that provide quantitative and / or qualitative data that are
    helpful in understanding the various aspects of regional integration
    processes. The perspectives of these platforms may differ in the geographic focus or
    a specific thematic focus, but nonetheless contribute to understanding and completing the picture
    of regional integration processes world-wide.

    In case we are missing an important platform in this overview, or you would like to see your own
    platform / database to be part of our collection,  please do
    not hesitate to send us a <a href="mailto:bfuhne@cris.unu.edu">mail</a>.
