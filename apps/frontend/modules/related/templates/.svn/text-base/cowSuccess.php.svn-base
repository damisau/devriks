<p>
    The objectives of the CoW database:
</p>
<p><I>
The Correlates of War project seeks to facilitate the collection, dissemination,
and use of accurate and reliable quantitative data in international relations.
</p>
<p>
Key principles of the project include a commitment to standard scientific
principles of replication, data reliability, documentation, review, and the
transparency of data collection procedures.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, we are committed to the free public release of data sets to
the research community, to release data in a timely manner after data collection
is completed, to provide version numbers for data set and replication tracking,
to provide appropriate dataset documentation, and to attempt to update,
document, and distribute follow-on versions of datasets where possible.
We intend to use our website as the center of our data distribution efforts,
to serve as central site for collection of possible error information and
questions, to provide a forum for interaction with users of Correlates of War
data, and as a way for the international relations community to contribute to
the continuing development of the project.
