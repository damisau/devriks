    ARIC about ARIC:
</p>
<I><p>
    The vision of an integrated, poverty-free, prosperous, and peaceful Asia and
    Pacific underlies initiatives to support regional cooperation and integration
    (RCI) in the region. Changing world economic realities have highlighted the
    importance of closer economic cooperation in the region and the need within
    ADB for a coherent and strategically focused approach to RCI.
</p>
<p>
    Building on its previous initiatives on regional cooperation, ADB has developed
    a coherent RCI strategy by consolidating its efforts since the early 1990s.
    On 25 July 2006, the ADB Board of Directors endorsed the RCI Strategy,
    in which ADB plays an active role as catalyst, coordinator, and knowledge leader
    of RCI in Asia and the Pacific. The RCI Strategy has four pillars:
    <ul>
        <li>Regional and Subregional Economic Cooperation Programs
        (Cross-border Infrastructure and Software)</li>
        <li>Trade and Investment Cooperation and Integration</li>
        <li>Monetary and Financial Cooperation and Integration</li>
        <li>Cooperation in Regional Public Goods</li>
    </ul>
