    "<I><img src="http://www.zei.de/zei_neu/zei_logo/zei.jpg" style="float:left">Over the past decade, the global trend of region-building has significantly
    increased. In cooperation with a worldwide network of experts, the Center for
    European Integration Studies at Bonn University endeavours to monitor these
    processes through its “ZEI Regional Integration Observer”
    (editors: Ariane Kösler / Matthias Vogl). The publication intends to enhance
    mutual knowledge and is published three times a year for presenting the dynamics
    and the interdependency of regional integration and to establish a platform for
    exchange.</I>"
